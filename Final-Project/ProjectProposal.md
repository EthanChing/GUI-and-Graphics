# Final Project Proposal

**Abstract:** Take [the primitive game engine](https://github.com/scottlafetra/intuition)
that I made in high school and remake it in C++ with OpenGL.

What was [*The Intuition Engine*](https://github.com/scottlafetra/intuition)?

* My first foray into graphics programming
* A rudimentary game engine powered by OpenGL and LWJGL
* Hierarchal System
* AABB Collision only
* Written in Java, whilst learning Java
* Everything is based on matrices
* No multithreading support

What will this project entail?

* Will be written in C++
* Will use the GLFW library for interfaceing with OpenGL
* Will be an ECS-based system
* Polish the graphics systems of the old system

What will I be able to do with this framework?

* The goal is to be able to reimplement a simple game I made called [Colors](scott.lafetra.com/work) 
to work in the new system. 

## Steps to complete

- [x] Get a working GLFW window to render
- [x] Implement a bare bones ECS to hold the scripts
- [ ] Make camera component 
- [ ] Make transform component
- [ ] Make material component
- [ ] Make mesh component
- [ ] Make renerder component
- [ ] make a simple component that moves stuff

*Asignment Done*

- [ ] Make a physicsBody component
- [ ] Make a collider component and a working collsision system (AABB for now)
- [ ] Implement the core parts of Colors or implement some other basic game

*Stretch complete*
